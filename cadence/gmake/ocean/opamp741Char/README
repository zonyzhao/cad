Description
===========
Contains several scripts to characterize an opamp for spectre

Definition of the Files
=======================

README
    This file.

dc.ocn
    This script runs dc analysis and uses calculator functions to determine:
    - Operating range of large signal. 
    - Offset voltage
    - Input offset current 
    - Input bias current
    - Static power dissipation
    - DC gain in common mode 
    - DC gain in differential mode

ac.ocn
    This script runs ac analysis and uses calculator functions to determine:
    - Bandwidth (BW)
    - Gain bandwidth product (GBW)
    - Phase margin (PM)
    - Differential mode input resistance
    - Common mode input resistance
    - Differential gain and phase 
    - Common gain and phase 
    - CMRR

tran.ocn
    This script runs tran analysis and uses calculator functions to determine:
    - Rise/fall time
    - Slew rate
    - Overshoot
    - Settling time

noise.ocn
    This script runs noise analysis.

rout.ocn
    This script runs dc analysis to find out output resistance.

ilimit.ocn
    This script runs ac analysis to find out short circuit current limiting.

opampTest.ocn
    The ocean script which loads in all the above characterization scripts.
