Corner.ocn
    This script runs the Corners analysis by simply switching the model paths.

Data
======================

The design.  (The (raw) spectreS netlist.)
./design/inv2.c  
./design/inv2_schematic.s

The models. 
./nmos/max
./nmos/typ
./nmos/min
./pmos/max
./pmos/typ
./pmos/min

Additional Information
=======================
 
These tests all use 'simulator' net/inst names.
The tests can also use 'schematic' names.  If the script is
generated from Artist, schematic names will be used.
If schematic names are used, then you MUST also have the
Artist-generated amap directory in your design (neltist)
directory.
 
This test does not include /design/amap, because simulator names
are used.
